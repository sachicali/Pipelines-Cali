### Memory Access Patterns
The README system accesses memory through:
- Content tracking
- Feature analysis

- Historical analysis

### Example Memory Query
```ruby
# Query README memory for feature descriptions
features_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'Section',
  name: 'Features'
)

# Query README memory for recent updates
recent_updates_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'Change',
  date: '2025-01-18'
