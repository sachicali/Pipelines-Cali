# TO-DO

This document outlines the tasks required to improve the application and address the issues identified during the code analysis.

## Implement Missing Helper Methods in `YouTubeChannelAnalyzer`

The following helper methods in `lib/pipeline/youtube_channel_analyzer.rb` need to be implemented:

-   `calculate_avg_views`: Calculates the average views per video.
-   `calculate_engagement_rate`: Calculates the engagement rate (likes + comments / views).
-   `find_best_upload_days`: Determines the optimal days for uploading videos based on historical data.
-   `find_best_upload_times`: Determines the optimal times for uploading videos based on historical data.
-   `calculate_consistency_score`: Calculates a score representing the consistency of the upload schedule.
-   `calculate_view_growth_rate`: Calculates the growth rate of views over time.
-   `calculate_engagement_trends`: Analyzes trends in engagement metrics.
-   `identify_top_performers`: Identifies the top-performing videos based on views and engagement.
-   `recommend_upload_schedule`: Generates recommendations for the upload schedule based on the analysis.
-   `recommend_content_strategy`: Generates recommendations for the content strategy based on the analysis.
-   `generate_optimization_tips`: Generates tips for optimizing video titles, descriptions, and tags.

## Complete `fetch_videos_data` in `YouTubeChannelAnalyzer`

Implement the `fetch_videos_data` method in `lib/pipeline/youtube_channel_analyzer.rb` to retrieve video-specific data from the YouTube API. This data is essential for a comprehensive analysis.

## Complete `YouTubeDataVisualizer` Implementation

Add the chart generation logic to the `YouTubeDataVisualizer` class in `lib/pipeline/youtube_data_visualizer.rb`. This will enable the visualization of analysis results using the `Gruff` charting library.

## Investigate Open Tabs Issues

Once the core functionality is implemented, conduct a more focused investigation into the specific issues related to open tabs. This may involve using browser developer tools, analyzing server logs, or other debugging techniques.
