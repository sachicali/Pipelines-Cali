# Project TO-DO List

## 1. TO-DO

This document outlines the tasks required to improve the application and address the issues identified during the code analysis.

## 2. Implement Missing Helper Methods in `YouTubeChannelAnalyzer`

The following helper methods in `lib/pipeline/youtube_channel_analyzer.rb` need to be implemented:

-   `calculate_avg_views`: Calculates the average views per video.
-   `calculate_engagement_rate`: Calculates the engagement rate (likes + comments / views).
-   `find_best_upload_days`: Determines the optimal days for uploading videos based on historical data.
-   `find_best_upload_times`: Determines the optimal times for uploading videos based on historical data.
-   `calculate_avg_likes`: Calculates the average likes per video.
-   `calculate_consistency_score`: Calculates a score representing the consistency of the upload schedule.
-   `calculate_view_growth_rate`: Calculates the growth rate of views over time.
-   `calculate_engagement_trends`: Analyzes trends in engagement metrics.
-   `identify_top_performers`: Identifies the top-performing videos based on views and engagement.
-   `recommend_upload_schedule`: Generates recommendations for the upload schedule based on the analysis.
-   `recommend_content_strategy`: Generates recommendations for the content strategy based on the analysis.
-   `generate_optimization_tips`: Generates tips for optimizing video titles, descriptions, and tags.

## 3. Complete `fetch_videos_data` in `YouTubeChannelAnalyzer`

Implement the `fetch_videos_data` method in `lib/pipeline/youtube_channel_analyzer.rb` to retrieve video-specific data from the YouTube API. This data is essential for a comprehensive analysis.

## 4. Complete `YouTubeDataVisualizer` Implementation

Add the chart generation logic to the `YouTubeDataVisualizer` class in `lib/pipeline/youtube_data_visualizer.rb`. This will enable the visualization of analysis results using the `Gruff` charting library.

## 5. Investigate Open Tabs Issues

Once the core functionality is implemented, conduct a more focused investigation into the specific issues related to open tabs. This may involve using browser developer tools, analyzing server logs, or other debugging techniques.

## 6. High Priority

- [ ] Enhance API rate limiting

## 7. Medium Priority
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Implement multi-language support
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Add API versioning
- [ ] Improve test coverage

## 8. Low Priority
- [ ] Add social sharing features
- [ ] Implement user profiles
- [ ] Add export functionality
- [ ] Create mobile app
- [ ] Add gamification elements

## 9. Memory Context

### 9.1 TO-DO Memory Structure
The TO-DO memory is organized as follows:

- **9.1.1 TO-DO Root**
  - Type: TO-DO
  - Description: Root node for all TO-DO-related memory
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: Main Project Memory
    - Connected to: Priority Memories

- **9.1.2 Priority Memories**
  - Type: Priority
  - Description: Memory nodes for each priority level
  - Observations:
    - Stores task details
    - Tracks task progress
    - Maintains task dependencies
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: TO-DO Root
    - Connected to: Task Memories

### 9.2 Memory Integration
The TO-DO system integrates with the project memory through:

1.  **9.2.1 Task Tracking**
   - Each task is logged in memory with:
     - Task description
     - Priority level
     - Status (todo/in-progress/done)
     - Assigned developer
     - Due date

2.  **9.2.2 Progress Tracking**
   - Task progress is tracked in memory with:
     - Completion percentage
     - Time spent
     - Remaining effort
     - Blockers

3.  **9.2.3 Dependency Tracking**
   - Task dependencies are stored in memory with:
     - Dependent tasks
     - Impact analysis
     - Critical path

4.  **9.2.4 Historical Tracking**
   - Task history is stored in memory with:
     - Change history
     - Completion times
     - Performance metrics
     - Lessons learned

### 9.3 Memory Access Patterns
The TO-DO system accesses memory through:
- Task tracking
- Progress monitoring
- Dependency analysis
- Historical analysis

### 9.4 Example Memory Query
```ruby
# Query TO-DO memory for high priority tasks
high_priority_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'Priority',
  level: 'high'
)

# Query TO-DO memory for completed tasks
completed_tasks_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'Task',
  status: 'done'
)
