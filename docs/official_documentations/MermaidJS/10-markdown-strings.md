## Markdown Strings [â€‹](#markdown-strings)

The "Markdown Strings" feature enhances flowcharts and mind maps by offering a more versatile string type, which supports text formatting options such as bold and italics, and automatically wraps text within labels.

Formatting:

* For bold text, use double asterisks (`**`) before and after the text.
* For italics, use single asterisks (`*`) before and after the text.
* With traditional strings, you needed to add `<br>` tags for text to wrap in nodes. However, markdown strings automatically wrap text when it becomes too long and allows you to start a new line by simply using a newline character instead of a `<br>` tag.

This feature is applicable to node labels, edge labels, and subgraph labels.

The auto wrapping can be disabled by using

```
