### Editors and IDEs

For coding in Ruby, you can use the default editor of your operating
system. By the way, to be more effective in coding, it is worth choosing a source code editor with basic Ruby support (e.g.
syntax-highlighting, file browsing) or an integrated development
environment with advanced features (e.g. code completion, refactoring,
testing support).

Here is a list of popular editors used by Rubyists, broken up by
learning curve:

* Days
  + [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (paid)
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/ruby)
  + [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
* Months
  + [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) (paid)
* “Years” (as in, you’ll spend years still learning things about it)
  + [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
 [Ruby mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RubyMode) or [Enhanced Ruby mode](https://github.com/zenspider/enhanced-ruby-mode/)
  + [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) with [vim-ruby](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby) plugin
  + [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

All of these editors support the Language Server Protocol (LSP),
either by default or through their LSP plugins. Shopify’s
[ruby-lsp](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) is one of the most popular language servers for
Ruby and [supports all of the above editors](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/editors.html).
