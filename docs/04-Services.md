# Services Documentation

## Core Services

### Channel Service
- `app/services/pipeline/channel_service.rb` - Main channel service
- Responsibilities:
  1. Channel data retrieval
  2. Channel validation
  3. Channel analysis coordination

### Cache Service
- `lib/pipeline/services/cache_service.rb` - Caching service
- Features:
  - Data caching
  - Cache invalidation
  - Cache expiration

### Metrics Service
- `lib/pipeline/services/metrics_service.rb` - Metrics service
- Capabilities:
  - Metric collection
  - Metric analysis
  - Metric storage

## Service Patterns

### Service Initialization
```ruby
service = Pipeline::ChannelService.new(params)
```

### Service Execution
```ruby
result = service.call
```

### Error Handling
```ruby
begin
  service.call
rescue Pipeline::Errors::ServiceError => e
  # Handle error
end
```

## Service Configuration
- Configured in `lib/pipeline/configuration.rb`
- Environment-specific settings in `config/environments/`

## Memory Context

### Service Memory Structure
The service memory is organized as follows:

- **Service Root**
  - Type: Service
  - Description: Root node for all service-related memory
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: Main Project Memory
    - Connected to: Service Type Memories

- **Service Type Memories**
  - Type: ServiceType
  - Description: Memory nodes for each service type
  - Observations:
    - Stores service configurations
    - Tracks service usage statistics
    - Maintains service dependencies
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: Service Root
    - Connected to: Service Instance Memories

- **Service Instance Memories**
  - Type: ServiceInstance
  - Description: Memory nodes for individual service instances
  - Observations:
    - Stores instance parameters
    - Tracks instance execution
    - Maintains instance results
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: Service Type Memories
    - Connected to: Cache Memories

### Memory Integration
The service system integrates with the project memory through:

1. **Service Tracking**
   - Each service execution is logged in memory with:
     - Service type
     - Start time
     - End time
     - Status
     - Results

2. **Cache Management**
   - Cache operations are stored in memory with:
     - Cache key
     - Operation type (read/write)
     - Data size
     - Timestamp

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Service metrics are tracked in memory with:
     - Metric type
     - Value
     - Timestamp
     - Context

4. **Error Tracking**
   - Service errors are stored in memory with:
     - Error type
     - Stack trace
     - Service context
     - Timestamp

### Memory Access Patterns
The service system accesses memory through:
- Service execution tracking
- Cache performance monitoring
- Metrics collection and analysis
- Error logging and analysis

### Example Memory Query
```ruby
# Query service memory for channel service statistics
channel_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'ServiceType',
  name: 'ChannelService'
)
