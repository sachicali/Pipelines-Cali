# API Documentation

## API Endpoints

### API Version 1

#### Controllers
- `app/controllers/api/v1/` - Contains version 1 API controllers

#### Routes
API routes are defined in `config/routes.rb`

#### Authentication
Authentication is handled by...

#### Error Handling
API errors are managed through...

#### Rate Limiting
API rate limits are configured in...

#### Example Requests
```bash
# Example GET request
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/endpoint

# Example POST request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"value"}'
```

#### Response Format
All API responses follow the format:
```json
{
  "data": {},
  "meta": {},
  "errors": []
}

## Memory Context

### API Memory Structure
The API memory is organized as follows:

- **API Root**
  - Type: API
  - Description: Root node for all API-related memory
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: Main Project Memory
    - Connected to: Version 1 Memory

- **Version 1 Memory**
  - Type: API Version
  - Description: Memory node for API version 1
  - Observations:
    - Contains controllers, routes, and authentication details
    - Stores rate limiting configurations
    - Maintains error handling patterns
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: API Root
    - Connected to: Endpoint Memories

### Memory Integration
The API system integrates with the project memory through:

1. **Request Logging**
   - Each API request is logged in memory with:
     - Timestamp
     - Endpoint
     - Parameters
     - Response status

2. **Error Tracking**
   - API errors are stored in memory with:
     - Error type
     - Stack trace
     - Request context

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Rate limit usage is tracked in memory with:
     - Client identifier
     - Request count
     - Time window

4. **Endpoint Documentation**
   - API endpoint details are stored in memory with:
     - Path
     - HTTP method
     - Parameters
     - Response format
     - Example requests

### Memory Access Patterns
The API system accesses memory through:
- Direct memory queries for rate limiting
- Error logging to memory
- Request tracking for analytics
- Documentation retrieval for API explorer

### Example Memory Query
```ruby
# Query API memory for endpoint details
endpoint_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'APIEndpoint',
  path: '/api/v1/analytics'
)
