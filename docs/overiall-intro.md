### 3.3 Worker Layer

-   **Background Jobs:** Process data asynchronously, perform analysis, and generate reports.
-   **Queues:** Manage job execution and prioritize tasks.
-   **Workers:** Execute specific tasks, such as channel analysis, data visualization, and notifications.

### 3.4 Service Layer

-   **YouTube API Service:** Interacts with the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data.
-   **Analytics Processing Service:** Aggregates and analyzes data to generate metrics.
-   **Recommendation Service:** Generates content recommendations based on user preferences and channel data.
-   **Notification Service:** Handles email and push notifications.
-   **Channel Service:** Manages channel data retrieval, validation, and analysis.
-   **Cache Service:** Provides data caching and invalidation mechanisms.
-   **Metrics Service:** Collects, analyzes, and stores system metrics.

### 3.5 Model Layer

-   **Channel Model:** Represents YouTube channels and their attributes.
-   **Video Model:** Represents YouTube videos and their attributes.
-   **AnalyticsReport Model:** Stores analytics data for channels and videos.
-   **Recommendation Model:** Stores video recommendations.
-   **ApplicationRecord:** Base model class for all models.
-   **Concerns:** Includes reusable model logic, such as YouTube channel validation.

### 3.6 Configuration Layer

-   **Application Configuration:** Manages application settings and environment variables.
-   **Database Configuration:** Configures database connection settings.
-   **API Configuration:** Configures API authentication, rate limiting, and other settings.
-   **Security Configuration:** Manages security headers and content security policy.

### 3.7 Testing Layer

-   **Unit Tests:** Test individual model functionality.
-   **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions.
-   **System Tests:** Test full system behavior.
-   **Performance Tests:** Test system performance.

### 3.8 Memory Layer

-   **Main Memory:** Root node for all project-related memory.
-   **Sub-Memories:** Organize memory into logical sections, such as API, GUI, Workers, Services, Models, Configuration, and Testing.
-   **Memory Integration:** Tracks data changes, errors, and performance metrics.

## 4. Technology Choices

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

1.  **Setup Development Environment:**
    -   Install Ruby, Rails, and other dependencies.
    -   Configure the database and environment variables.
    -   Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies and prepare the application.
2.  **Develop Core Components:**
    -   Implement the API layer with authentication and rate limiting.
    -   Develop the GUI layer with React components and Stimulus controllers.
    -   Create background jobs for data processing and analysis.
    -   Implement core services for interacting with the YouTube API and processing data.
    -   Define models and their relationships.
3.  **Implement Testing:**
    -   Write unit tests for models and services.
    -   Write integration tests for API endpoints and component interactions.
    -   Write system tests for user workflows.

    -   Add new features and enhancements.
    -   Continuously improve the system's performance and reliability.

## 6. Memory Usage

The system uses a structured memory approach to track various aspects of the application. Each component (API, GUI, Workers, Services, Models, Configuration, and Testing) has its own memory structure, which is integrated with the main project memory. This allows for efficient tracking of data changes, errors, and performance metrics.

-   **API Memory:** Tracks API requests, errors, rate limits, and endpoint documentation.
-   **GUI Memory:** Tracks view renders, controller events, asset usage, and user interactions.
-   **Workers Memory:** Tracks job executions, queue performance, and worker metrics.
-   **Service Memory:** Tracks service executions, cache operations, metrics, and errors.
-   **Model Memory:** Tracks model operations, schemas, associations, validations, and queries.
-   **Configuration Memory:** Tracks configuration changes, environment settings, and initializer executions.
-   **Testing Memory:** Tracks test executions, performance, coverage, and failures.
