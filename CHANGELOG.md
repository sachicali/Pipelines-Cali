## Memory Context

### CHANGELOG Memory Structure
The CHANGELOG memory is organized as follows:

- **CHANGELOG Root**
  - Type: CHANGELOG
  - Description: Root node for all CHANGELOG-related memory
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: Main Project Memory
    - Connected to: Version Memories

- **Version Memories**
  - Type: Version
  - Description: Memory nodes for each version
  - Observations:
    - Stores version details
    - Tracks changes
    - Maintains release history
  - Relations:
    - Connected to: CHANGELOG Root
    - Connected to: Change Memories

### Memory Integration
The CHANGELOG system integrates with the project memory through:

1. **Version Tracking**
   - Each version is logged in memory with:
     - Version number
     - Release date
     - Changes
     - Authors
     - Impact analysis

2. **Change Tracking**
   - Changes are stored in memory with:
     - Change type (added/changed/fixed)
     - Description
     - Impact
     - Related issues
     - Performance metrics

3. **Release Tracking**
   - Releases are stored in memory with:
     - Release notes
     - Deployment history
     - Rollback information
     - Post-release metrics

4. **Historical Tracking**
   - Historical data is stored in memory with:
     - Version history
     - Change patterns
     - Performance trends
     - Lessons learned

### Memory Access Patterns
The CHANGELOG system accesses memory through:
- Version tracking
- Change analysis
- Release monitoring
- Historical analysis

### Example Memory Query
```ruby
# Query CHANGELOG memory for version 1.0.0
version_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'Version',
  number: '1.0.0'
)

# Query CHANGELOG memory for recent changes
recent_changes_memory = Memory.query(
  type: 'Change',
  date: '2025-01-18'
)
